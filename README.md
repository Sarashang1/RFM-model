# RFM-model

## Introduction:
RT Bank, one of Canada's premier banking institutions, boasts over 1000 branches nationwide. In pursuit of enhancing customer loyalty and optimizing sales contributions, the bank sought to implement a CRM RFM dashboard. This dashboard is envisaged to assist the Business â€“ CRM Services department in elevating profitability and fostering increased customer loyalty. The emphasis is on informed Campaign Planning & Design, which is rooted in the results of meticulous analysis.

## Project Objective:
To create a long-term, robust production solution that facilitates segment-based customer insights, allowing for tailored marketing campaigns and deeper customer engagement.

### 1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:

**Data Source:** The initial dataset, sourced from RT Bank's internal database, was provided in Excel format.

**Data Processing in SQL Server:**
- Loaded the data into the SQL Server.
Conducted data cleaning which encompassed:
  - Handling missing data.
  - Removing duplicates.
  - Ensuring data format and data type consistency.
- Post-cleaning, custom queries were written to extract data necessary for the RFM model dashboard.

**Integration with PowerBI:**
- Connected the SQL Server database to PowerBI.
- Developed a star schema within PowerBI to streamline dashboard development.

### 2. Dashboard Development in PowerBI:

**Metrics Creation:**
Devised measures to compute total transaction amounts and overall customer counts.

RFM Analysis:
**Recency:** Measures the time since a customer's last purchase.
**Scoring:** Customers scoring 1 had a recency greater than the 75th percentile; 2 for recency greater than 50th percentile; 3 for greater than 25th, and 4 for the rest. The rationale is that recent transactions indicate a higher likelihood of future engagements.

**Frequency:** Gauges how often a customer transacts.
**Scoring:** Customers scoring 4 exceed the 75th percentile in frequency; 3 for above 50th percentile; 2 for above 25th, and 1 for the rest. The purchase cycle can influence frequency, and understanding this can drive targeted marketing efforts.

**Monetary Value:** Represents the total monetary value a customer brings.
**Scoring:** Customers scoring 4 surpass the 75th percentile in monetary contributions; 3 for above 50th percentile; 2 for above 25th, and 1 for the rest. The goal is to emphasize high spenders without neglecting consistent, albeit lower-spending, customers.

**Segmentation and Visualization:**

Based on RFM scores, customers were segmented and descriptions penned for each segment.
